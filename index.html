  <h1>LAB 2 - TRANSFORMATIONS</h1>  
  <h2>Task 1</h2>
  <p>Rotate the cube periodically around a random axis passing thought the origin.</p>

  <h2>Task 2</h2>
  <p>Rotate the cube periodically around a random axis that doesn’t pass thought the origin.</p>

  <h2>Task 3</h2>
  <p>Apply anisotropic scaling to the cube that is not aligned with the axes.</p>

  <h2>Task 4</h2>
  <p>Rotate the cube around the y-axis by a random angle, then periodically rotate around the x-axis.</p>

  <h2>Task 5</h2>
  <p>Rotate the cube around the y-axis by a random angle, then periodically around its local x-axis after the rotation.</p>

  <h2>Task 6 (optional)</h2>
  <p>Investigate additional transformations (beyond scaling, rotation and translation) that can be expressed in the form x’ = Ax</p>
  <p>Shear</p>


  <h2>Task 7 (optional)</h2>
  <p>Periodically rotate the camera around the cube.</p>
